# Twitch Recognition

Still a work in progress

Idea is to scan a player's steam profile for a url to twitch.tv.  It would be
assumed that they put their own url on their profile.  Then that twitch
channel is queried to check if it is currently streaming. If it is then that
player is streaming live on the server right now.
